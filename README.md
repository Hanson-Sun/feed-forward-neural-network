# feed-forward-neural-network
 a little fun with FFNNs in C++. A basic implementation of a FFNN, as an exercise to learn ML along with c++. 

## Current issues
- slow convergence rates (requires a lot of epochs)
- unstable converging behavior
- RELU vanishing problem
- really unoptimized and slow c++ code...

## Todo
- test FFNN with MNIST dataset
- refactor and optimize math library
- figure out a direct matrix approach 
- implement cross-validation and other proper analysis methods
- test out some variable learning rate algs (momentum, ADAM, ...)
