# feed-forward-neural-network
 a little fun with FFNNs in C++. A basic implementation of a FFNN, as an exercise to learn ML along with c++. 

## Current issues
- (BUG) Terminate is called recursively once a certain amount of memory is reached
- can have further code optimizations

## Todo
- test FFNN with MNIST dataset
- figure out a direct matrix approach 
- implement cross-validation and other proper analysis methods
- test out some variable learning rate algs (momentum, ADAM, ...)
